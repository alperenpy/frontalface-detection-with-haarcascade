# Face Detection with OpenCV

This project utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in real-time using the Haar Cascade classifier.

## Description

The application captures video from a camera and detects faces in the frames. When a face is detected, a rectangle is drawn around it, and the label "face" is displayed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

# Make sure haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml is in the same directory as the script.
